# Tabletop-Cleaning-Zamboni
The Tabletop Cleaning Zamboni was created to help reduce the time and effort required to maintain clean surfaces. The cleaning robot is built using a car chassis with two DC motors connected to a motor shield powering the wheels. Once power is provided to the device, it is turned on by pushing a button. After the button is pressed, a red LED turns on to indicate that the device is running. Equipped with IR line tracking sensors, the Zamboni is capable of traversing elevated surfaces without falling off the edges. The back of the car chassis is outfitted with a dusting pad that cleans the tableâ€™s surface while it travels across it. The total weight of the Tabletop Cleaning Zamboni is under 3 pounds, making its functionality well suited to those with disabilities. Please refer to Product Description pdf for more information.
